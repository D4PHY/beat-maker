1. parentNode.append()
appendChild() vs append() : append() method will insert a javascript Node object
and also a DomString object after the last child of a parent node.

2. Remove everything after a certain character
const song = "kick-mama.wav"; // kick-mama.wav
const songLabel = song.split("-")[0]; // kick

3. Remove duplicate values from JS array
ES6 provides the Set object, which makes things a whole lot easier:
const duplicates = ["mama", "tata", "mama", "dafi", "nicu", "tata"]; // mama, tata, mama, dafi, nicu, tata
duplicates = new Set(duplicates); // mama, tata, dafi, nicu

4. Select Events
Not a good ideea to put event handlers on select option (aka, selector: "option", event: "click"
- it seems to somehow work in Firefox, but not in Chrome),
more reliable is to add a "change" event on the "select" and use its value.
